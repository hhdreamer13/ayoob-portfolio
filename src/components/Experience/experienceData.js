      "The project required the development of Radio Patrol software, an intelligent mobile network performance analysis and monitoring system that could connect to various OSS data sources, collect raw data, aggregate, filter, calculate custom KPIs, manage events, generate alarms, and produce  advanced cellular network optimisation reports. As this was a telecom project, the software department lacked KPI calculation expertise. I was responsible for extracting the KPI formulas from the OSS raw data, writing the algorithms, and supervising the programmers to ensure the algorithms were implemented accurately.",
